# Catalyst

**Library for advanced modding needs of BTA 7.1**

Catalyst is split into modules, the current available modules are described below. 

It can be downloaded and used by downloading the **Core** module mod + other required modules mods, or it can be downloaded as one mod with all the modules (Catalyst: All).

Each module has an individual version! Not every module is updated each release.

The all modules package cannot be used in development, you have to implement the modules you want to use when making your own mod separately.

Available modules:
- Core
  - The core module, **every other module depends on this**. Adds misc utility classes for modules and other mods to use. Makes creating GUIs that work in MP easier.
- Fluids
  - Improved api for fluid storage and transportation.
- Energy
  - Adds a simple, configurable energy api.
- Multiblocks
  - Adds support for multiblock structures/machines.
- Effects
  - API for custom attributes and stackable effects.
